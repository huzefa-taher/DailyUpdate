This is a project I made that to learn more about apis and smtp servers. When run, this program will email me the weather which includes the temperature, the humidity, and sky cover and more followed by the top 10 trending articles on BBC world. The reason I created this program is because it is something I need. I consistently forget to check the weather and the news in the morning, I am running this program off a raspberry pi and so every morning as I get ready, I am able to quickly and easiy check the weather while also getting updated on the current trending news.
